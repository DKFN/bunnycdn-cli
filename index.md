## Getting started

#### Early rabbit notice
Sorry, the documentation is still work in progress like the projet.

I suggest you to open the [README](https://github.com/DKFN/bunnycdn-cli/blob/master/README.md) if you want to try it

I strongly suggest that you wait v0.5 before using this CLI in automated processes because the commands may change until the whole BunnyCDN API is implemented.

#### [Installation]()
Follow installation procedures dependings on your installation desires

## Contribute
Contributions are very welcomed, if you are not really sure how to start it feel free to join my discord (link pending) and let me know what's up :)

Contributions may be as simple as trying the CLI and letting me know what you found unconvenient or convenient, outside looks are welcomed !
