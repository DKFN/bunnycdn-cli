# Downloading file or directories

Downloading a file into a storage is done via cp command, directories with -R (recursive) option

Make sure you have a storage password stored and then use `cp`

A read only storage password is enough for downloads, but you can use standard password of course.

*Please note that there is no progress bar as of now, backgrounded large file downloads may look idle.*
